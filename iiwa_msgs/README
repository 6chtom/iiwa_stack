IIWA_MSGS

The current iiwa_msgs module contains the following ROS messages :

CartesianPosition - a ROS PointStamped message, representing the coordinates X,Y,Z of a Frame.

CartesianRotation - a 3x3 Matrix (in the form of a 9 elements vector), representing the rotation of a Frame.

CartesianVelocity (*) - a 3x3 Matrix (in the form of a 9 elements vector), representing the velocity of a Frame.

CartesianWrench - a ROS WrenchStamped message, representing the linear and angular force components on a Frame.

JointPosition - a 7 elements vector, representing the joint angles of the IIWA robot in radians.

JointStiffness - a 7 elements vector, representing the joint stiffness of the IIWA robot.

JointTorque - a 7 elements vector, representing the torque on the individual joints of the IIWA robot.

JointVelocity (*) - a 7 elements vector, representing the velocity of the individual joints of the IIWA robot.

All the messages include an ROS Header message that can contain a timestamp, a sequence number and a frame identificator. Stamped messages in ROS naturally come equipped with an Header.

(*) Note that the RoboticsAPI from KUKA currently don't implement a Velocity control schema, you should implement that yourself on Sunrise Worksbench.
