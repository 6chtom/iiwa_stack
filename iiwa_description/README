IIWA_DESCRIPTION

This package contains the URDF for both KUKA IIWA LWR R800 and R820
You can load the robot_description using the launch files : 
iiwa7_upload.launch - for the LWR R800
iiwa14_upload.launch - for the LWR R820

The URDF are parametric, you can select two parameters :

- hardware_interface : PositionJointInterface, EffortJointInterface or VelocityJointInterface.      
Default : PositionJointInterface

NOTE : you are able to select the last two, but they are not yet implemented.
To implement them, iiwa_control and iiwa_hw have to be integrated.

- robot_name : The given name will be used as namespace for every rosparam, rostopic and rosnode used in this stack. 
Default : iiwa.

 EXAMPLE :

 roslaunch iiwa_description iiwa7_upload.launch robot_name=Pluto

 This will load the robot description of a LWR R800 that used PositionJointInterface as Trasmission under /Pluto/robot_description.
