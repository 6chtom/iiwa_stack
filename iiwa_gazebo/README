IIWA_GAZEBO

This package contains the files to use a KUKA IIWA LWR R800 or R820 with Gazebo.
You can load a robot in Gazebo using the launch file iiwa_gazebo.launch

The file is parametric, you can select : 
- hardware_interface : PositionJointInterface, EffortJointInterface or VelocityJointInterface. Default : PositionJointInterface

NOTE : you are able to select the last two, but they are not yet implemented.
To implement them, iiwa_control and iiwa_hw have to be integrated.

- robot_name : The given name will be used as namespace for every rosparam, rostopic and rosnode used in this stack. Default : iiwa.

- model : iiwa7 or iiwa14. To use a LWR R800 or R820. Default : iiwa14.

- trajectory : true or false. Boolean to select if you want to use 7 single Joint Controllers (one for each joint) or a Joint Trajectory Controller. Default : true.

EXAMPLE : 

roslaunch iiwa_gazebo iiwa_gazeno.launch robot_name=Pluto model=iiwa14

This will open Gazebo spawning an IIWA LWR R820 robot controller by a Joint Position Trajectory controller, all the nodes and topics will be under the namespace /Pluto (e.g. /Pluto/...)

NOTES : 
For the iiwa14 (LWR R820) everything seems to work.
For the iiwa7 (LWR R800) nothing works, we don't have the correct inertial parameters in its URDF, changing them to the right one should fix the thing.
As we don't use Gazebo that much, not much of this is tested.
