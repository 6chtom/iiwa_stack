# How to put the required Java code on the iiwa

The iiwa stack requires an additional Sunrise application running on the robot. A Sunrise project is very bound to the version of the Sunrise controller that runs on the robot, so it is not possible to distribute a Sunrise project with the stack.

Here are described the steps needed to create an own Sunrise project, and add the applications needed with their dependencies.

1. Create a Sunrise project, or load an existing one from the controller
2. Right-click on your Sunrise project and choose _Build Path_ -> _Configure Build Path..._
3. Go to the _Source_ tab and click the _Link Source_ button
4. Browse to the location of the folder _iiwa\_stack_/_iiwa\_ros\_java_/_src_ to use it as linked folder location
5. Choose a folder name different than _src_
6. Do not choose any inclusion/exclusion pattern and finish
7. Go to the _Libraries_ tab and click the _Add External JARs..._ button
8. Add all of the JARs contained in the _iiwa\_stack_/_iiwa\_ros\_java_/_ROSJavaLib_ folder

Your project is now ready to be uploaded to the controller. There should be no red sign or problem found by the IDE.
